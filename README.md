# Plant radiation

In this project there re 3 types of plants and 2 types of radiations: alpha and delta. Plants react differently on the same radiation, either by increasing or decreasing its nutrient. If the nutrient falls to zero, the plant dies.

Some plants increase the alpha radiation while others the delta. The actual radiation depends on the plants.

The program simulates the radiation throughout one year.
